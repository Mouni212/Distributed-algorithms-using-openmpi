# Distributed-algorithms-using-openmpi
Different algorithms like broadcast, reduce, scatter, gather, pi calculation are implemented on different architectures like linear array, matrix, tree, hypercube, fully connected graph using SMPI. Complete code is in Project-5 folder and details of project are available in Presentation-5.pdf
